	Algorithm: To accept a number and find whether is even or odd
				(Here n is the number)
	Step 1: Start
	Step 2: Read n
	Step 3: If n mod 2 = 0, then
				Print "Even"
			Else
				Print "Odd"
	Step 4: Stop

	Data structure is a particular organisation of data so that it can
	processed efficienlty
	
		-	Data structure can be modified dynamically (size/capacity)
